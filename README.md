# Podcast Timecode Shifter

An helper for podcast creators to automatically adjust timecodes based on the inserted ads in between. 

Working demo: https://serdarcevher.github.io/podcast-timecode-shifter/

- You can save your work as JSON files and load them back for possible future modifications,

- You can load your podcast audio (as an MP3 file) and double-check the modified timestamps on the fly by clicking on them,

- You can toggle the ads on the results column and copy shifted timecodes to use them in your podcast descriptions.
