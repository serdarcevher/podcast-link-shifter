# podcast-link-shifter

An helper for podcast creators to automatically adjust time links based on the inserted ads in between. 

- Supports saving your work as JSON files and loading them back for possible future modifications,

- Supports loading your podcast audio (as an MP3 file) hence double-checking the links on the fly by clicking on the timestamps,

- You can toggle the ads on the results column to copy the results and use them in your podcast descriptions.
